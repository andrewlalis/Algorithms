## Functionality

### Stack
The stack is probably the most basic storage structure, using the 'first-in, first-out' approach. The following functions are the only ones available for stack manipulation, as it is quite a minimalistic data structure.
* ``` Stack createStack() ```
* ``` void freeStack(Stack *s) ```
* ``` void pushToStack(int item, Stack *s) ```
* ``` int popFromStack(Stack *s) ```
* ``` void printStack(Stack s) ```

### Queue

### Linked List

### Heap (Priority Queue)
