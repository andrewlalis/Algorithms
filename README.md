## Functionality

### Stack
The stack is probably the most basic storage structure, using the 'first-in, first-out' approach.
* ```c Stack createStack()```
* ```c void freeStack(Stack *s)```
* ```c void pushToStack(int item, Stack *s)```
* ```c int popFromStack(Stack *s)```
* ```c void printStack(Stack s)```

### Queue

### Linked List

### Heap (Priority Queue)
